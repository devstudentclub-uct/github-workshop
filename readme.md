# DSC Github Workshop

This repo contains a script called `main.sh`, which simply executes all python files in its directory.

## Assignment

Do the following:

- Clone the repo onto your computer:

    $ git clone https://github.com/devstudentclub-uct/github-workshop.git

- Go into the cloned dir and make a new branch with your student number as name.

    $ git branch rtnjan001-branch
    $ # To view all branches, run this:
    $ git branch --list
    $ # Switch to your new branch:
    $ git checkout rtnjan001-branch

- Create a python file with your student number as name, e.g. `rtnjan001.py`.

- In that python file, write some code that prints your name:

    print("Hello, this is George coding")

- Commit that file.

    $ git add rtnjan001.py
    $ git commit -m "Added my own python file!"

- Push your commit to the online repo (`origin`). Be sure to specify your branch at the end.

    $ git push origin rtnjan001-branch
